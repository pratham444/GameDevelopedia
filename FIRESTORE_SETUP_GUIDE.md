# üî• Firestore Setup Guide - Fix Permission Error

## The Problem
You're getting "Missing or insufficient permissions" because your Firestore database doesn't have the correct security rules set up yet.

## üöÄ Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Set Up Firestore Database
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **porfoliowebsite444**
3. Click on **"Firestore Database"** in the left sidebar
4. If you haven't created a database yet:
   - Click **"Create database"**
   - Choose **"Start in test mode"** 
   - Select your preferred location
   - Click **"Done"**

### Step 2: Update Security Rules
1. In Firestore Database, click on the **"Rules"** tab
2. Replace the existing rules with this:

\`\`\`javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to all public collections
    match /games/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    
    match /tutorials/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    
    match /team/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    
    match /blogs/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    
    match /contact/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    
    // Allow contact form submissions
    match /contact_messages/{document} {
      allow read: if false;
      allow write: if true;
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

3. Click **"Publish"** to save the rules
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for the rules to propagate

### Step 3: Add Data to Your Database
1. Run the populate script to add sample data
2. Or manually add collections in the Firebase Console

### Step 4: Test Your Website
1. Refresh your website
2. Check if the sections now load data instead of showing loading states
3. Test the contact form

## üîç Verification Steps

### Check if Firestore is Working:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
2. You should see collections: `games`, `tutorials`, `team`, `blogs`, `contact`
3. Each collection should have documents with data

### Check if Rules are Applied:
1. In Firestore ‚Üí Rules tab
2. You should see the rules we added above
3. The status should show "Published"

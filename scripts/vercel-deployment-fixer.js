🔧 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIXER
=========================

Let's diagnose and fix your Vercel 404 error:

🔍 DIAGNOSIS CHECKLIST:
======================

1. ❓ Do you have app/page.tsx file?
   This is your homepage - REQUIRED for Next.js App Router

2. ❓ Is your package.json correct?
   Must have "build", "start", "dev" scripts

3. ❓ Do you have next.config.mjs?
   Required for proper Vercel deployment

4. ❓ Are there any build errors?
   Check Vercel build logs for TypeScript/ESLint errors

5. ❓ Are environment variables set?
   Firebase and EmailJS variables must be in Vercel dashboard

🚀 QUICK FIXES TO TRY:
=====================

Fix #1: FORCE REDEPLOY
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
- Click latest deployment → "Redeploy"

Fix #2: CHECK BUILD LOGS
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
- Click failed deployment → View "Build Logs"
- Look for specific error messages

Fix #3: VERIFY PROJECT STRUCTURE
Make sure you have:
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx          ← CRITICAL: Your homepage
│   ├── layout.tsx        ← CRITICAL: Root layout
│   └── globals.css
├── components/
├── lib/
├── package.json          ← CRITICAL: Build scripts
└── next.config.mjs       ← CRITICAL: Vercel config

Fix #4: TEST LOCALLY FIRST
Run these commands in your project folder:
\`npm install\`
\`npm run build\`
\`npm run start\`

If it works locally but not on Vercel = configuration issue
If it doesn't work locally = code issue

Fix #5: CHECK ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY

🆘 EMERGENCY SOLUTION:
====================

If nothing works:
1. Delete the Vercel project
2. Re-import your repository
3. Set up environment variables again
4. Deploy fresh

This usually fixes 90% of deployment issues!

📋 WHAT TO CHECK NEXT:
=====================

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Check the build logs for specific errors
3. Verify your app/page.tsx file exists
4. Make sure environment variables are set
5. Try a force redeploy

Let me know what you find in the build logs! 🔍

🚨 VERCEL 404 ERROR TROUBLESHOOTING
==================================

You're getting a 404 NOT_FOUND error. Let's fix this step by step:

📋 STEP 1: CHECK YOUR PROJECT STRUCTURE
=====================================

Make sure your repository has this EXACT structure:

your-repo/
├── app/                    ← REQUIRED for Next.js App Router
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx           ← This is your homepage!
│   └── favicon.ico
├── components/
├── lib/
├── public/
├── package.json           ← REQUIRED
├── next.config.mjs        ← REQUIRED for proper deployment
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json

🚨 MOST COMMON ISSUE: Missing app/page.tsx file!

📋 STEP 2: VERIFY PACKAGE.JSON
=============================

Your package.json should have these scripts:

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}

📋 STEP 3: CHECK NEXT.CONFIG.MJS
===============================

Make sure you have next.config.mjs with this content:

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  }
}

export default nextConfig

📋 STEP 4: VERIFY YOUR APP/PAGE.TSX FILE
======================================

Your app/page.tsx should be the main entry point:

import { Navigation } from "@/components/sections/navigation"
import { HeroSection } from "@/components/sections/hero-section"
// ... other imports

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen bg-deep-black">
      <Navigation />
      <HeroSection />
      {/* ... other sections */}
    </main>
  )
}

📋 STEP 5: CHECK VERCEL BUILD LOGS
=================================

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the failed deployment
5. Check the "Build Logs" for specific errors

Common build errors:
- Missing dependencies
- TypeScript errors
- Import path issues
- Missing environment variables

📋 STEP 6: QUICK FIXES TO TRY
============================

Fix 1: Redeploy
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
- Click on latest deployment → Click "Redeploy"

Fix 2: Check Environment Variables
- Go to Settings → Environment Variables
- Make sure all your Firebase and EmailJS variables are added

Fix 3: Force New Deployment
- Make a small change to your code (add a comment)
- Push to Git: git add . && git commit -m "Force redeploy" && git push

📋 STEP 7: MANUAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
=======================================

Check these files exist in your repository:

□ app/page.tsx (your homepage)
□ app/layout.tsx (root layout)
□ app/globals.css (global styles)
□ package.json (with correct scripts)
□ next.config.mjs (Next.js configuration)
□ components/ folder with all your components
□ lib/ folder with Firebase and other utilities

📋 STEP 8: IF STILL NOT WORKING
==============================

1. Check if your repository is public (Vercel needs access)
2. Verify Vercel is connected to the correct repository
3. Check if there are any TypeScript or ESLint errors
4. Make sure all imports use correct paths (@/components/...)

🔧 EMERGENCY FIX: RECREATE DEPLOYMENT
====================================

If nothing works:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Delete the current project
3. Import your repository again
4. Set up environment variables again
5. Deploy fresh

💡 PRO TIP: LOCAL TESTING
========================

Before pushing to Git, always test locally:
1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npm run start

If it works locally but not on Vercel, it's usually a configuration issue.

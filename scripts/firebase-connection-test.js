üîç FIREBASE CONNECTION DIAGNOSTIC
================================

Let's check if your Firebase is properly connected:

üìã STEP 1: CHECK ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
====================================

Your current environment variables should be:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyALJWumsV1X12TcGdJNnSJ8nIwS3MgMlBI
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=porfoliowebsite444.firebaseapp.com
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=porfoliowebsite444
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=porfoliowebsite444.firebasestorage.app
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=453223925799
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:453223925799:web:a1439524ab662219806602

üìã STEP 2: VERIFY LOCAL VS PRODUCTION
===================================

LOCAL (Preview) - Works ‚úÖ
- Uses .env.local file
- Firebase connection successful
- Data loads properly

PRODUCTION (Deployed) - Not Working ‚ùå
- Missing environment variables in Vercel
- Firebase connection fails
- No data loads

üìã STEP 3: QUICK DIAGNOSIS
=========================

Open your deployed website and:
1. Press F12 (open developer tools)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for these error messages:

‚ùå "Firebase app initialization error"
‚ùå "Missing or insufficient permissions"
‚ùå "Failed to get document"
‚ùå "Network request failed"

If you see any of these, your environment variables are missing in Vercel!

üìã STEP 4: FIX THE ISSUE
=======================

The solution is to add environment variables to Vercel:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: gamedevelopedia-website (or your project name)
3. Click on it
4. Go to "Settings" tab
5. Click "Environment Variables" in left sidebar
6. Add each variable one by one:

Variable Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
Value: AIzaSyALJWumsV1X12TcGdJNnSJ8nIwS3MgMlBI
Environment: Production, Preview, Development

Variable Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
Value: porfoliowebsite444.firebaseapp.com
Environment: Production, Preview, Development

Variable Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
Value: porfoliowebsite444
Environment: Production, Preview, Development

Variable Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
Value: porfoliowebsite444.firebasestorage.app
Environment: Production, Preview, Development

Variable Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
Value: 453223925799
Environment: Production, Preview, Development

Variable Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
Value: 1:453223925799:web:a1439524ab662219806602
Environment: Production, Preview, Development

7. After adding all variables, REDEPLOY your project:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

üìã STEP 5: VERIFY THE FIX
========================

After redeployment:
1. Visit your live website
2. Check if games section shows your data
3. Open browser console - should see no Firebase errors
4. Your game from Firebase should now appear!

üö® COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
===========================

‚ùå Forgetting to redeploy after adding environment variables
‚ùå Typos in variable names (they're case-sensitive!)
‚ùå Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
‚ùå Wrong environment selection (make sure all 3 are checked)

‚úÖ WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN AFTER FIX:
===============================

- Your deployed website will connect to Firebase
- Games, team, blog, tutorials will load from Firebase
- Contact form will work properly
- No more console errors
